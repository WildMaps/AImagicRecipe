# AI Magic Recipe

Welcome to the AI Magic Recipe repository for WildMaps! This repository contains the code and resources necessary for the AI preparation phase of the project. The AI Magic Recipe focuses on preparing and optimizing images for training the machine learning models used in WildMaps.

## Overview

The AI Magic Recipe provides a set of steps to prepare and resize images for optimal training of machine learning models in the WildMaps project. By following this recipe, you can ensure consistent image sizes and enhance the accuracy of the models used for biodiversity data analysis in the Patagonia region.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Magic Recipe, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-magic-recipe.git


2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:


## Usage

The AI Magic Recipe involves the following steps:

1. Place your original images in the `orquidea_litoral` folder.

2. Run the provided Python script `resize_images.py`:


This script resizes the images in the `orquidea_litoral` folder to a size of 400x400 pixels and saves the resized images in the `orquidea_litoral_resize` folder.

3. Customize the code in `resize_images.py` according to your specific requirements, such as input/output file paths or additional preprocessing steps.

4. Explore other additional steps mentioned in the [Additional Steps](#additional-steps) section below, if needed.

## Additional Steps

In addition to resizing the images, you may need to perform other preprocessing steps specific to your AI model and training requirements. Consider creating separate code files for each step and providing instructions on how to use them in this section of the README.md file. Some common additional steps include:

- Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, or adding noise to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- Applying image filters or transformations to enhance image quality or remove unwanted artifacts.
- Normalizing the pixel values or applying other preprocessing techniques to standardize the input data.

Please refer to the relevant code files and instructions provided in this repository for more information on additional preprocessing steps.
